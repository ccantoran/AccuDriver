# Welcome to my AccuDriver readME!
this project was created to help aid dispatchers in the trucking industry coordinate loads better by having a dashboard that would hold a driver's drive time and total weekly hours.

# How It Was Made 
Tech used was NodeJS, EJs, HTML and CSS. 

On speaking with my friends in the transportation industry I realized that a lot of smaller brokers don't have a way to keep track of their driver's drive time or their weekly hours. This could potentially be dangerous and a problem for the driver and company. I decided to create an app that could solve this issue with little involvement from dispatch. Using MongoDB I was able to save start and stop times and manipulated the data to fit the times I needed and would be necessary for dispatch.

# Optimizations
This project will be refactored in React. In addition to refactoring some of the code, I also intent on integrating Twilio or some phone messaging system that would bypass the button feature. 

#Lessons Learned 
I learned how to better handle requests with date objs and how to extract information that I needed from those objs.
